## Ideas

### Version Control:

use version control from deployment repo to show the version history of the system

### Repo introspection

Using LLM to inspect and understand repo structure, with features and connections

### Minimal UI:

The constant question: is it possible to not use a navbar item for this feature?

For everything regarding "customizing the experience" a navbar is acceptable.
Example:

- RBAC
- Profile config

### Better zoom

cc

### Relive event

In the tracing layer, identify the components and connections related to a certain event (e.g. place order), highlight them and let it be able to re-live them using a timeline that could appear as a panel in the bottom.

### Devops view

In the Infra layer, be able to see everything of the cluster, like namespaces, pods, kubelet etc.

### Universal search

Self-explanatory. cmd+k and be able to search ANYTHING

### Multi-collaboration

Multiple users, collaborating in real-time. Implement a chat feature to facilitate communication and collaboration among team members.

## Open questions

- Layout: auto or manual?
