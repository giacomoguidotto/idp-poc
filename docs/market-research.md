# Market Research — Kubernetes & Internal Developer Platforms

> **TL;DR**: ~80% of container-using orgs run K8s in production. 50% of companies (150+ devs) already use an IDP, 35% plan to within 12 months. Biggest pain points: 7.4-tool sprawl costing 6–15 hours/week, 78% waiting a day+ for SRE help, 94% dissatisfied with self-service tools. Backstage dominates open-source; Port, Cortex, OpsLevel lead commercial. No public data exists for input-device preferences in platform UIs — instrument your own product.

## 1. Kubernetes Adoption

There is no single "% of all companies worldwide using K8s" because most companies have no container workloads. What is measured reliably is adoption **among container users / surveyed orgs**.

- **82%** of container users run Kubernetes in production (2025)
  — [CNCF Annual Survey](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2026/01/20/kubernetes-established-as-the-de-facto-operating-system-for-ai-as-production-use-hits-82-in-2025-cncf-annual-cloud-native-survey/)
  — [CNCF Report](https://www.cncf.io/reports/the-cncf-annual-cloud-native-survey/)

- **~80%** of organizations run Kubernetes in production (enterprise-focused survey)
  — [Komodor 2025 Report (PDF)](https://komodor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Komodor-2025-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Report.pdf)

**Cite as**: "Kubernetes is used in production by ~80%+ of container-using organizations in recent large surveys."

## 2. Rate of K8s Adoption in New Companies

No clean "new adopters per year" metric is publicly published in a credible way. CNCF indicates new cloud-native adoption is slowing — only a small share remains "early stage / not using."

**Best proxy**: Track year-over-year change in "% running K8s in production" within the CNCF survey population.

## 3. Number of Devs and Services

### Developers per company

No standard public benchmark. Depends on industry, region, company size distribution, contractor inclusion. Stack Overflow Developer Survey has respondent-level data but not company-wide averages.
— [Stack Overflow 2025](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/developers/)

**Practical approach**: Segment by company size (e.g. "companies with 150+ devs" per Port's reports, or "mid-market SaaS 200–2000 employees").

### Services (microservices) per company

No broadly accepted public metric. Case studies exist at specific large companies but aren't generalizable.
— [Alibaba trace analysis (research)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13141)

**Recommendation**: Treat service count as a banded variable (< 50, 50–200, 200–1000, 1000+) and validate with interviews/telemetry.

---

## 4. IDP Adoption

Measured more often as "Internal Developer Portals" (Backstage-like). Best public stats are survey-based.

- **50%** already use an internal developer portal; **35%** plan to in the next 12 months
  (Port's 2024 sample: engineering leaders at companies with 150+ devs)
  — [Port 2024 PDF](https://info.getport.io/hubfs/2024%20state%20of%20internal%20developer%20portals_edited.pdf)
  — [Port 2024 landing page](https://port.io/state-of-internal-developer-portals-2024)

- Port's 2025 report adds adoption/usage signals including tool usage patterns and metadata approaches.
  — [Port 2025](https://www.port.io/state-of-internal-developer-portals)

**Caveat**: Port is a vendor. Treat these as survey insights, not a definitive market census.

---

## 5. IDP Competitive Landscape

### Open-source

**Backstage** is the dominant open-source framework for internal developer portals.
— [Port 2024 PDF](https://info.getport.io/hubfs/2024%20state%20of%20internal%20developer%20portals_edited.pdf)

### Commercial

Based on ecosystem visibility (not a neutral market-share ranking):
**Port**, **Cortex**, **OpsLevel**, **Roadie** (Backstage SaaS), plus emerging vendors.
— [TFIR survey context](https://tfir.io/survey-understanding-backstage-and-internal-developer-portals-in-2025)

A true "most common by market share" list requires paid analyst research. No credible free public market-share table exists.

## 6. Biggest Pain Points with Current IDPs

From Port's 2025 report (300 devs, US & Western Europe, orgs with 150+ devs):

| Pain Point | Stat |
|------------|------|
| Tool sprawl | Average **7.4 tools** for everyday operational tasks |
| Productivity loss | **75%** lose **6–15 hours/week** to tool sprawl |
| Waiting on SRE/DevOps | **78%** wait **a day or more** for assistance |
| Self-service dissatisfaction | **94%** dissatisfied with self-service tools |
| Low trust in metadata | Only **3%** say data quality is completely trustworthy; **50%** have doubts |

- [DevOps.com summary](https://devops.com/survey-increased-tool-sprawl-saps-developer-productivity/)

### What this means for Orray

- **Reduce context switching** — unify discovery + action in a single spatial interface
- **Make ownership/dependencies obvious** — service maps, blast radius visualization
- **Shorten the "ask platform team" loop** — guardrailed self-service (I17 runbook actions)
- **Make metadata trustworthy** — provenance/freshness transparency

## 7. Input Devices for Platform Inspection

No credible public research directly answers: "for inspecting an IDP, what % use mouse vs trackpad vs touch vs keyboard vs pen?"

[Forrester 2025 end-user computing report](https://www.forrester.com/report/end-user-computing-market-insights-2025/RES181968) (paywalled) may contain device/input trends but not IDP-specific.

**Best approach**: Instrument the product and publish your own metrics:
- Pointer usage vs keyboard shortcut usage
- Session device class (desktop/laptop/tablet)
- Touch vs mouse/trackpad via Pointer Events (`pointerType`)
- Complement with 10–20 targeted usability studies across roles (dev, SRE, EM)
